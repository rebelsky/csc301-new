# Demonstration Exercises

We will assign demonstration exercises every week of the term except the last.
As described in the [syllabus]({{ "/syllabus/" | relative_url }}), these are meant to be completed *individually*.
You should only talk to the course staff regarding the content of these exercises.

Demonstration exercises do not have a fixed due date.
Instead, each week has a *window* where you can turn in up to *two demonstration exercises*.
These may either be new demonstration exercises, *i.e.*, the "current" demo, or revisions from previous weeks.
See [the schedule]({{ "/schedule" | relative_url }}) for the list of windows for the semester.
