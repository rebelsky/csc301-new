# Learning assessments, outcomes, and such

These Learning outcomes were formed by Nicole Eikmeier, Peter-Michael Osera, and Anya Vostinar with the help of Vanessa Preast in Spring-Summer 2020.  They were adapted and edited by Samuel A. Rebelsky in Summer 2021.

List of topics
--------------

a. Program/Algorithm correctness/verification by construction
b. Loop Invariants
c. Formal proof of asymptotic classes: Little oh, big Omega, Big Theta
d. Solving recurrence relations
e. Using the Master Theorem
f. Comparison Based Sorts are lower bounded by nlog(n)
g. Bucket Sort & Radix Sort
h. Topological Sort
i. Algorithm Design Strategies:
    * Exhaustive Search
    * Divide & Conquer
    * Greedy Algorithms
    * Dynamic Programming
j. Network flow
k. Bipartite graphs/matching
l. Tries
m. Union find/Disjoint sets
n. Something from the primary literature
o. Balanced trees

Learning outcomes
-----------------

* Given a problem statement, students can write/develop a loop invariant alongside an algorithm, and can prove the correctness of their algorithm via a loop-invariant technique. 
* Students can recite the formal definition of Big-Oh, little-oh, Big-Omega and Big-Theta, and formally prove properties of these classes.
* Students can prove asymptotic bounds on iterative algorithms with non-trivial nesting.
* Students can explain why comparison-based sorts take order nlogn in the worst case.
* Students can reproduce Radix, Bucket, and Topological Sorts, and explain the context in which these sorting algorithms are useful.
* Given an algorithm which uses Divide-and-Conquer, students can develop a recurrence relation for that algorithm.
* Given a recurrence relation, students can solve the relation using the Master Theorem and other techniques.
* Students can consider different algorithmic design strategies when solving problems.
* Students can solve problems using each of divide and conquer, greedy, and dynamic techniques.
* Students can adapt network flow algorithms to solve appropriate network problems.
* Students can implement an advanced data structure or algorithm, demonstrating good software design practices including documentation and testing.
* Students can explain the tradeoffs between different data structures when they are used for similar problems.
* Students can implement a balanced tree.
* Students can read and understand a primary source from the literature of algorithms.
* Students can explain how structural racism or other unexpected consequences can manifest in algorithm design.

Types of writing 
-----------------

This course employs a variety of genres of writing typically used in the discipline.  In particular, students will write,

* _Proofs_ in mathematical English.
* _Program code_ in a variety of languages (including Scheme, C, and Java)
* _Documentation_ that explains the goals and expectations of functions, data structures, and compositions of functions and data structures, such as in objects/classes or full programs.
* _Unit tests_ that help verify the correctness of code.
* _Claim-based essays_ in English.
