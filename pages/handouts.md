You'd think the [syllabus](../syllabus) and [schedule](../schedule)
would provide all the info you need for a course, wouldn't you?  But
I've found over the years that it can be helpful to provide additional
information.  To ensure that you read the information, I even give you
[an assignment](../assignments/survey).  What else is there?  Let's see.

## Teaching, grading, and such

[On teaching and learning](teaching)
  : A bit of philosophy (more or less)

[Grading](grading)
  : More details on grading processes (and a bit on the underlying philosophy).

[Gradescope](gradescope)
  : A few notes on the grading platform we're using.

## Other important issues

[Accommodations and adjustments](accommodations)
  : Policies and practices (and why I use two terms)

[Accessibility of Web pages](accessibility)
  : Why I try to keep pages accessible and who to report to when they're not.

[Academic honesty](academic-honesty)
  : A long document that explains academic honesty in this course and in the discipline.

## Secondary topics

[Some thoughts on electronic mail](email)
  : While we'll be using Teams, this page provides some details about how to best use electronic mail when dealing with me.

[An old FAQ](faq)
  : I'm not sure when this is from.  I've kept it around for some reason.  I made a few changes for this term, but not enough.

## Some Scheme Stuff

[The Zen of Booleans](zen-of-booleans)
  : Expressing some Boolean expressions more concisely.

[SamR's Style Guide for Racket](style-guide)
  : Opinions and expectations on what your code should look like.

## Other materials

These aren't strictly handouts, but I didn't have another place for them.

[EBoards for CSC 151 2021 Spring Term 1 (Rebelsky)](../eboards)
  : The notes I take during class each day, more or less.

[CSC 151 2020 Fall Term 2 (Rebelsky)](https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/Courses/CSC151/2020FaT2)
  : Last term's offering of the course

CSC 151 2020 Fall Term 1 (Osera)
  : The first term-based offering of the course, not currently available online.

[CSC 151 2019 Spring (Rebelsky)](https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/Courses/CSC151/2019S/home/)
  : The first offering of this version of the CSC 151 course (in a fourteen-week semester).
