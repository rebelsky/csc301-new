### Q&A

Working on MSTs
---------------

There was enough concern about HW9 that I thought we'd use today's class
to make some progress.

Survey question one: _How should we run today's class?_  (Vote for
as many as you want.)

* Collaborative coding with Sam at computer (all but 2)
* Pair coding (1)
* Individual coding (2)
* First half full-class, second half pair/individual (3)
* First half pair/individual, second half full-class (4)
* I don't care. (2)

Survey question two (if appropriate): _What language?_ (Vote for as
many as you want.)

* C (3)
* Scheme (3)
* Java (Many) WINS (Sam loses)
* Python (Many)
* Ruby
* I don't care (2)

Survey question three (if appropriate): _What should I focus on?_ (feel free
to add others; vote for as many as you want)

* "Is it connected?" (8)
* Heaps (3)
* Union-find structures (9) THE WINNER
* Testing infrastructure (10)
* ???
* ???
* ???
