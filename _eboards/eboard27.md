### Q&A

Implementation Strategies
-------------------------

* Work out the details
* Look for counter-examples
* Consider running time
* Try to prove correct
* During presentation, others will also think about counter-examples

### Exhaustive search/brute force

### Divide and conquer: Find MST in each half, combine

### Greed: Removing edges greedily

### Greed: Adding edges greedily

### Greed: Adding nodes greedily
