*Summary*: In this assignment, you will reflect on the potential for
bias in the design or use of algorithms, as well as the ways in which
we considered the topic in class.

*Purposes*: To get you to think more about the implications of the
algorithms we write and use.

*Collaboration* (programming): You may discuss this assignment with
anyone you like, provided you credit such discussion when you submit
the assignment.  Each person should write up his, her, zir, or their
own work and submit it individually.

*Submitting*: Turn in your work as a PDF on Gradescope.  Make sure

your file.

*Warning*: So that this assignment is a learning experience for everyone,
we may spend class time publicly critiquing your work.

In class, we watched _Coded Bias_ and considered some of the issues
from the film as a class.  In a one-page essay (single spaced, 12 pt.,
8.5 x 11 inch paper, 1 inch margins, Times or Times New or CMR), reflect
on (a) the ways in which bias can appear in the design or use of
algorithms and (b) ways in which computing professionals can address
such bias.

In addition, write one paragraph on how we might improve the coverage
of these issues in CSC-301.
